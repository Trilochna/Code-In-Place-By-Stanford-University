Code in Place is an act of community service over 900 teachers from around the world came together to 
offer a first-of-its-kind volunteer-led course called Code in Place, hosted by Stanford University. 
Code in Place was a great, uplifting, learning experience and over 10,000 students learned how to code 
in Python.
