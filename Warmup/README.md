Instructions
Your task: Write a program in the editor, that makes Karel move, pick a beeper, then move.

The "editor" is the area to the right with the tab heading "main.py" where you can write text. You should write a solution as a Karel program.

Your program should have a main function with three commands:

1. move()
2. pick_beeper()
3. move()

When you hit the run button, your program will execute line-by-line. After it finishes, Karel's world should look like this:
