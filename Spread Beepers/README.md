You may assume that:

There is only one row in the world

Karel starts with infinite beepers in her bag

The pile of beepers is on the second corner, directly in front of where Karel starts

The world is wide enough for all the beepers, with at least one beeper at the end

Write the code to implement Spread Beepers Karel. Come up with a strategy first. Think, "what are the high-level steps Karel needs to take?" and make these steps into helper functions. Remember that your program should work for a pile of any size.
