# Draw Flag

Instructions
Students in Code in Place are from 150 different countries! Wow. Let's celebrate our international class by drawing flags. To start out, one of the most straightforward flags to draw using python graphics is the flag of Indonesia:

The dimensions of your flag should be based off the provided constants:

# The width of the canvas
CANVAS_WIDTH = 450
# The height of the canvas
CANVAS_HEIGHT = 300

To draw the Indonesian flag all you need to do is to draw a single red rectangle which covers the top half of the graphics canvas. You don't need to draw the white stripe, the canvas is white by default.

Once you have drawn the Indonesian flag, feel free
